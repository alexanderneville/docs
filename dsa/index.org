#+TITLE: Data Structures & Algorithms

An /algorithm/ is fundamentally a sequence of instructions for solving a problem. There is not a single specification nor one formal language for writing and interpreting algorithms, they are an abstract concept. The role of a /data structure/ is to manage how a programâ€™s information is stored and accessed. /Concrete/ data structures implement the /abstract data types/. For any program, the algorithms it implements and the organisation of its data are important components of the solution.
