An *algorithm* is fundamentally a sequence of instructions for solving a
problem. There is not a single specification nor one formal language for
writing and interpreting algorithms, they are an abstract concept. The
role of a *data structure* is to manage how a program's information is
stored and accessed. *Concrete* data structures implement the *abstract
data types*. For any program, the algorithms it implements and the
organisation of its data are important components of the solution.
