#+TITLE: Introduction to Git

A version control system records changes made to a file or set of files, making it possible to view and recover previous versions as required.

* Snapshots

#+begin_src
v1
File A
File B
File C

#+end_src


* States

- /Modified/ files exist with changes in the working directory, but those changes have not yet been added to the git database.
- /Staged/ files are marked, so that their current version is added to the database at the next commit.
- /Committed/ files have a current snapshot in the git database.
