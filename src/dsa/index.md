An _algorithm_ is a sequence of instructions for solving a problem.
There is not a single specification nor one formal language for writing
and interpreting algorithms, they are an abstract concept. The role of a
_data structure_ is to manage how a program's information is stored and
accessed. _Concrete_ data structures implement the _abstract data
types_. For any program, the algorithms it implements and the
organisation of its data are important components of the solution.
